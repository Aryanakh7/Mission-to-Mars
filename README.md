# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of the Analysis 

The purpose of this analysis is to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images as requested in the Module Challenge.

Subsequently, the scraped data is stored on a Mongo database, and a web application will display the data, while altering the design of the web app in order to accommodate Mars' hemispheres.

Here is a screenshot of the final results as displayed on the web app:
